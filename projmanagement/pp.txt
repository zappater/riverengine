Outline
-------------
2D game engine (front page)
The idea (brief description of the project)
Datastructure (picture of how all classes are linked)
---
Acts (what does an act do and how does it work?)
Levels (how are they written and why?)
---
Objects (picture of how all object classes are linked)
Granpa (why do we want all objects to have these properties?)
Characters (why do all characters exist this way and why no NPC class?)
Player Character (whats different and why is interact implemented that way?)
Other classes (things which were not implemented and how they would work in the existing datastructure)
---
Communication - Globals (how does objects communicate with each other and why do they use acts as intermediaries?)
Drawing the world (outline/picture of all parts for drawing the game on the screen)
Draw (how does draw work and why?)
Textures (why did we choose to do it this way?)
UI (why this is a different system and how it works)
Input (how we wanted to handle it and the compromise we did and why)
A map editor (how it is implemented and a short demonstration)
Demo (a short demonstration of what you can make with our game engine)
----
Problems (What took more time than expected and how Racket makes things hard)
The Future (What will happen to the project)
