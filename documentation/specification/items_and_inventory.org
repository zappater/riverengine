The following is a plan for implementing a lot of shit
The idea is to have a functioning combat and inventory system at the end

A fun thing to note, implementing multiplayer combat will be easy
just make sure the act changes *current-PC* everytime a turn ends.
Of course this isn't networked multiplayer but it is still multiplayer

* Items
objects
** Base modifiers
All items will have:
A use function, similar to interact for characters

* Inventory
object

* Combat act
A normal act but with type combat-act instead and
it handels turns so combat is turn-based
